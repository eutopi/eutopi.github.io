Where cobbled roads that dug into my insoles stretched on for miles without respite. But this time, her waters were murkier, and her skies cloudier.

Perhaps a sense of danger too.<br></br><br></br>\r\n                    \r\n                    But this time, when I peer outside at 3am, too many lights glare back like angry fireflies. The silence felt calm. Yet I could not fall asleep, and instead think about a city very much like this one. Where peddlers entice passersby with the aroma of ripe fruit. Or where sunsets lasted longer, and impressed their images onto the clear rivers below. Bickering ducks disrupt this reflection as they fight over the last morsel of bread tossed overboard. But the restless ripples fall still soon, and the river returns to grey—as dull as the irises of the peddlers returning home from a long day of work.</span>,\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    title: \"Butterfly\",\r\n                    date: \"5/16/2020\",\r\n                    post: <span>I finished my last class of undergrad recently. It was a little uneventful, a little boring. The professor spoke about the brightness of our futures, that there was no need to be sad for our parting despite the current times, though I don’t recall anyone on the Zoom call actually being sad. The wrong season, perhaps.<br></br><br></br>\r\n\r\n                    Parting probably shares the same color as summer’s end instead: afternoon sunlight streaming through the leaves, a drawstring hat gently carried by the wind. There is a sense of loss here that I can’t seem to place, a certain notion of finality. Sometimes, I miss the lazy summer days where I sat by the windowsill and binged One Piece, the Percy Jackson series, <i>Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea</i>.<br></br><br></br>\r\n                    ​\r\n                    Or maybe parting has the hue of trains. I remember the incredible sense of sadness I felt when I rewatched the scene when Chihiro boarded the train with No Face to find Zenibaba, accompanied by Joe Hisaishi’s beautiful “The sixth station.” Or the time Taichi and the gang waved goodbye as the train carried them back to the real world.<br></br><br></br>\r\n                    \r\n                    Perhaps parting is only sad in retrospect.

A little delight—I found it in the piano sonata an old man was playing in the midst of a busy square next to the astronomical clock. He laced fairy lights around his keys, and I wanted to tell him it was obstructing his playing.

Somewhere far away, there is a car speeding through a dark tunnel. The headlights are broken, and there is no way to see much of the road ahead. Next to me sits the personification of unease: a light peck on the lips, conveying memories of a story I do not know. I whisper to the driver to step on the gas pedal. He nods in response, and we race through astonished ghosts, who drop their picnic baskets in surprise.<br></br><br></br>\r\n                    \r\n                    ​Three. She dances in the middle of a vacant living room. With all her belongings packed, the apartment never felt so strange as it did now. She wonders if the next family to live in this space will be a happy one, whether they will own a dog or like to eat a late breakfast on Sundays. Her Agumon stickers still remain on the left wall by the kitchen counter, and before she shuts the door behind her, she tells him not to miss her so much, for he, too, will forget her soon.</span>,\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    title: \"District vii, budapest, hungary\",\r\n                    date: \"7/7/2019\",\r\n                    post: <span>There, I lived on the sixth floor of an old neo-Classical apartment, neatly nestled between two bookstores. The one to my immediate left upon exiting the complex offered a weekly rotation of discounted novellas in a language I could not read. Next to the entrance sat a small Euronet ATM—a tourist trap for the ones who didn’t know any better. The street ahead was noisy, a conglomerate of shouting and honks occasionally suspended by the cadence of the emergency sirens.<br></br><br></br>\r\n\r\n                    The elevator ride up consisted of a narrow nine square feet platform, a full length mirror on one side, and wooden doors on the other that would open at the slightest touch, abruptly halting the ascent. It was a strange experience, for I could never decide how long that climb really took. When I was staring at myself in the mirror, trying to flatten that one stubborn strand of flyaway hair, it felt like mere seconds. Yet on the late nights when not even the heaviness of the walls surrounding me could make me feel safe in a foreign city 7000 kilometers away from home, the seconds felt like hours.<br></br><br></br>\r\n                    \r\n                    Upon entering through the wooden doors of the apartment, a sudden gust of wind would try to push you backwards. Perhaps this had to do with the particular arrangements of the windows—my flatmate and I always preferred to keep them open—or perhaps some ancient spirit was trying to keep strangers out. This was the urban legend my landlady told me when I first arrived, and I never asked her whether she was actually kidding or not. Maybe this explained why the sunlight cast through the windows would always be slightly tinted pink: a shy, gentle ghost.<br></br><br></br>\r\n                    \r\n                    ​My stay there wasn’t very long, only a mere four months, give or take a few days. I wasn’t particularly attached either, and bid it a light farewell on my last night. But sometimes, whenever I see a slightly chipped gargoyle statue, a wooden elevator, a fridge with a broken freezer door, I would think back to the old place, wondering whether the spirit there was lonely.</span>,\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    title: \"164\",\r\n                    date: \"2/6/2019\",\r\n                    post: <span>Someone once told me that whenever they purchased tickets to a place, they always had to book tickets away from that place, as if they did not belong anywhere, and this made them a little sad.

Upon entering, one would first notice the striking smell of some melange of herbs and ancient roots, a scent that seems to cling to me even now.<br></br><br></br>\r\n                    \r\n                    Whenever I return to the house, it was as if I was revisiting some earlier period in time. The walls of my room, in particular, are still adorned with watercolors, oils, and old concert posters from 2010. That was when my family first purchased the place, and as an eager sixth grader, I resolved then to make my room the very best that a child could ever own. It was an open exhibition of all my favorite things: the souvenir model of the first ship that sailed around the globe, a brass pocket watch with hands that rotated counterclockwise, a wonky paperweight of the Milky Way.<br></br><br></br>\r\n                    \r\n                    Yet as I grew older and these things gradually changed, I never really bothered with redecorating. And so, the past stuck to me like an adhesive, a cute little bandaid that is simultaneously endearing and uncomfortably restrictive. I think about tearing it off my skin, how much pain it would cause and how liberating it could be.<br></br><br></br>\r\n                    \r\n                    ​I think about how, in ten year’s time, I would like to buy a house with high ceilings near the sea.

It was a little gullible, so I would occasionally rotate its pot just to see how it would find the sun again. It was the perfect confidant, and I loved how picky it was about my singing: at the slight off-key note, its leaves would curl up in distaste, and at some point, this was the funniest thing in the world to me.<br></br><br></br>\r\n                    \r\n                    ​But on some days, I can’t figure out the right medium to describe these thoughts with.

Not a personal nostalgia, but something much older than I. As it strikes the corners of the travel brochure someone left behind, the latter curls up a little, as if stretching after a late noon nap. It casts long shadows across my parents’ blue-tinted wedding photo. The image is newly dusted, though I don’t think my father has smiled so brightly on camera since.

Perhaps it was something more than RNG that rendered it open when I screamed fuck you at some poor passerby taking a stroll that night. Or sometimes it would be closed so that we can still sing songs, written by other people, for other people. Those hours were a little chaotic, but nice. Yakult drinks were nice. The squid snacks were nice.<br></br><br></br>\r\n                    \r\n                    ​The third window was never really cleaned properly. When someone says New York City, it is always about the brilliant, bold things they meticulously polished, rehearsed a thousand times in front of a mirror only to drink away at some dimly-lit bar one September night. It is never the quiet, forgettable things, musings that ease up their scrunched eyebrows as they rest their heads for a short respite. But I tell myself that sometimes, this dirty window is kind. Sometimes, when the scenery outside is dark and I am the only person on this train, the lights across my city cast through this murky veil look like fireflies.\r\n                    </span>,\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    title: \"Too much and too little\",\r\n                    date: \"7/15/2018\",\r\n                    post: <span>i.

Not the floors that surround me right now—these have been owned by too many strangers. No, I am talking about the ones back home: red cedar planks that creak when you step on them, echoing the weight of your own existence.

The ringing of newly dusted wind chimes and the aroma of sun-baked sheets whenever I arrive home from a long semester. I never did say thank you. I still remember that time in fifth grade when she sat me down on a park bench and spoke about honesty and the weight of words. When she finally kissed me goodbye and said “I love you,” I heeded her teachings and replied with a “I don’t know what love is, so I don’t know if I love you.” And now whenever she tells me “I love you,” I instinctively answer “I love you too” because I hate to see her cry. <br></br><br></br>\r\n                    ​\r\n                    iii.

I can condition myself to love the ceiling fan too—quite the mundane response to mundane practicalities. And even without it, the ceiling would appear as unfamiliar, a mere relic from a stranger’s dream. It is raining today as well and there is no need to depart from these four walls. There is a bitter aftertaste somewhere, but the tongue records that as sweet. \r\n                    </span>,\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    title: \"Sound of rain\",\r\n                    date: \"5/6/2017\",\r\n                    post: <span>Yesterday, someone asked me to differentiate between 开心 and 快乐.

Pay the toll of two fish to pass and you are a guaranteed safe journey—teleportations per second dependent on the specific breed of cat unique to your address—to your desired destination. You can also choose not to pay two fish, if you are so inclined. The cats will merely nod in acknowledgement and suck out your soul in exchange, no big deal.

She liked waking up to the sound of squeaky shoes, flushing toilets, and arguing family. Sometimes, she purposefully neglected to comb through her black hair, left the split ends to the whim of air that sat dutifully in rooms without humidifiers. She wore her grandfather’s eyes.

A girl at her age should know better than to slouch in her seat—instead, she should speak in a soft, singsong voice and take pictures of herself smiling with straight, white teeth. That was how she could get others to love her. ​\r\n                    \r\n                    </span>,\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    title: \"Four years\",\r\n                    date: \"3/4/2017\",\r\n                    post: <span>The number four can be tastefully expressed in binary.

Yet each year, I still hang up LED lights and sing Christmas carols and countdown with the rest of the world.<br></br><br></br>\r\n\r\n                    But when fickleness renders even melancholy itself boring, there's nothing wrong with indulging in festive follies―\"it's a self-fulfilling prophecy!\" my friend likes to say. So I'll flood that fir tree with as many ornaments as I can get my hands on, scream the lyrics to \"Last Christmas\" just to annoy the person on the other end of the Skype call. There's nothing wrong with a girl getting tipsy off a few shots just before holiday break and accidentally shedding tears over something that ended quietly long ago. Nothing wrong with her shamelessly crashing a friend's dorm afterwards because if she slept alone that night, she probably would've cried more. My new year's resolution for 2017 is to become more honest with myself. That is to say, I wish supermarkets sold eggnog during all four seasons of the year, despite having personally spread the word that egg yolk is gross. I would gladly sacrifice the concept of pumpkin spice lattes if Santa granted this desire―oh wait, that is outside his job description and he doesn't even exist.<br></br><br></br>\r\n                    \r\n                    ​​That's the easy way to live. Don't drift off into REM sleep expecting a white Christmas at the ice rink in Bryant Park because global warming is very real and all you're waking up to is cold feet. Instead, Christmas Day is better spent under ten layers of blankets alternating between the Home Alone trilogy and Yuzuru Hanyu videos. Don't fall in love with the boy who reads Murakami because upon closer textual analysis, all his male protagonists are basically misanthropists with ear fetishes and a cultivated taste for jazz (is that my type?!). Run to the bathroom whenever you sense the conversation coming since A+'s are practically mythological creatures now that the glory days of high school are over. Everyone was a genius in elementary school, gifted and talented until college. Now, we are just average, though that itself is slightly comforting.\r\n                    </span>,\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    title: \"Like no one ever was\",\r\n                    date: \"12/9/2016\",\r\n                    post: <span>When virtual reality was still a term exclusive to the realm of science fiction, I was a snobby twelve-year-old who always hogged the restroom for twenty minutes too long.

I still periodically check my phone just in case a Dragonite or Lapras chances upon me, even though I do not sing in the showers anymore.<br></br><br></br>\r\n                    \r\n                    The clever bastards who made the App Store phenomenon know. We know. When the Millennials who grew up in the crevices between analog and digital willingly sold their childhoods to capitalism, we mutually understood yet never acknowledged that nostalgia was a drug. Saccharine toxins more reliable than any placebo, reminding you of the \"good ol' days\" when you had to rush to a Pokecenter before your favorite starter fainted due to poison, when possession of an Alakazam separated the cool kids from the plebs because no one knew how to trade, when your president did not look like a rabid Raticate. My generation.<br></br><br></br>\r\n                    ​\r\n                    I still relish the very moment it starts―whether that is in Pallet Town, Littleroot, or Twinleaf. After selecting the starter with the most aesthetic third evolution, you step into that first patch of wild grass and off you go, free in uncharted waters. Each time you defeat the evil team, name the legendary you caught with the master ball after your crush, and save the world, you selfishly wish that you can forget, just so you can feel that initial euphoria all over again.<br></br><br></br>\r\n                    \r\n                    But before you realized how huge Kalos was, they already threw you Alola. And it's sometimes hard to be the very best without a 3DS, especially when some snobby twelve-year-old has more time for EV training than you. \r\n                    </span>,\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    title: \"Times gone by\",\r\n                    date: \"12/5/2016\",\r\n                    post: <span>With a swift finger tap, a good internet friend of mine deactivated his art account the other day, effectively cutting off our sole source of communication.

A third party informed me that the girl I used to call \"bff\" in elementary school moved to New Jersey two months ago. It was all without much fanfare so I nonchalantly acknowledged the fact.<br></br><br></br>\r\n\r\n                    People are like Bruno Mars songs: easy come, easy go. Some leave a heavier trace of themselves than others, whether that is manifested in pixels of text designed to mimic human conversation or in polaroids that were way too expensive but regardless hastily purchased so that we, too, would be \"like the hipsters.\" But at least with the latter, I would have a face to place with the memories.<br></br><br></br>\r\n                    \r\n                    ✒ 2008. Memories of a time long ago when the term \"squad\" was not yet popularized through social media but we were the quintessential of squad.

When Andy had a football head and was way too obsessed with professional wrestling and Fantasy Football (tbh he probably still is). When Luke still spoke to us. It's only Izzy and I now. The stories of Kagami and Izumi, of Aria and Ilsa, remain unfinished, neatly archived in the back of my drawer somewhere, forever reminding me of our crazy antics and the fact that karma is always out to get us.<br></br><br></br>\r\n                    \r\n                    ✒ 2011.

Memories of \"Dicken bois\" with Eris and Wendy―Nir, Kiru, and Pikko―three street urchins against the world. It was the first time art trades and collaborations didn't feel like work. When everyone had a giant platonic crush on each other's art styles and in the universe of Rugiguji, our characters were infinite.\r\n                    </span>,\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    title: \"A change of scenery\",\r\n                    date: \"12/4/2016\",\r\n                    post: <span>4:35 PM marks the beginning of sunset. Too early for those who arose from their slumber mid-afternoon, yet too late for the individuals who subscribed to nyctophilia the moment the word home shifted from a cozy brownstone in the suburbs to a stuffy room identical to a hundred other ones hammered into the enormous building complex someone said was modeled after a ship. But you're located in the middle of nowhere. There is no water.<br></br><br></br>\r\n\r\n                    As compensation, the mountains are rather generous in the plant department. When deeper hues of mauve slowly splay across the sky, the trees outside twist and turn into amorphous shadows―large, wavering, yet strangely comforting. And when you pause for a moment, briefly counteracting the gravity pulling you downhill back to your room for a night of finals cramming, you notice a soft lull that lingers in the air. It politely sits there with the flickering lamp posts, almost comically threatening you, even though the most sinister presence here would be a lone squirrel chucking you acorns in indignation because you tried to approach it for a picture. <br></br><br></br>\r\n                    \r\n                    And as days turn into weeks and weeks into months, the walks through the embrace of the trees become routine. The same security beckons you, reminds you that even as a decent adult, it is sometimes still acceptable to shy away from responsibilities. You almost forget that your home was a place where the sea was objectively more attractive than the woods, where stars were either myths or airplanes traveling too slow for their own good. So when your mother asks why you haven't called, you are ashamed to admit that you googled \"homesickness\" and wonder why you do not look forward to concrete and pigeons as much as you should.<br></br><br></br>\r\n                    \r\n                    ​The trees back there were touched by too many human hands to be loved.

I woke up to lethargy and conceded to it, easing into my sheets while instinctively hitting the play button on my phone. Two birds, one stone. As the piano intro seamlessly transitioned into triggering words (simultaneously rendering myself personally attacked, but that's ok), I mumbled along.<br></br><br></br>\r\n\r\n                    When Toru noted the hypocrisy of human nature during student protests at Tokyo University, he wasn't kidding. I could still recall that skeptic from two months prior, scoffing at the plethora of love songs plaguing modern-day media, dismissing the friend who cried over the termination of a toxic relationship as childish.

When two hearts were aligned, it was something akin to milk and honey. But when uncomfortable silence gradually permeated the afternoon air, stuck to my lips like dust to hot glue, it was closer to a game of pretend―who is the better borderline masochist―all in bad fun, of course. And it was easy to settle into this cycle, remind yourself of hands that perpetually smelled of tangerines, the straining voice that cracked when reaching notes beyond high C. How stasis was a stage that benefitted no one. How weed and beer were terrible life choices that exacerbated your sore throat but were nonsensically acceptable because you're a college student and he liked them.<br></br><br></br>\r\n                    \r\n                    So I'll wait for the hustle and bustle to catch up to me, wait for time to accustom myself to a new pattern. Or perhaps the cycle would repeat once more for a different heartbeat, at a different rate per second, not like I had much significant say in the rhythm of my own. \r\n                    </span>,\r\n                }\r\n            ]\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    renderPost(post, index) {\r\n        return (\r\n            <div key={\"index_\" + index} className=\"light-text-standard\">\r\n                <div className='blog-post-title'>\r\n                    {post.title}\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div className='blog-post-date'>\r\n                    {post.date}\r\n                </div>\r\n                <hr></hr>\r\n                <div>\r\n                    {post.post}\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    render() {\r\n        return(\r\n            <div className=\"main-wrapper\">\r\n                <Topbar/>\r\n                <div className=\"about-wrapper\">\r\n                    <div className=\"flex-column pub-wrapper\">\r\n                        <div className=\"center\" style={{fontSize: \"0.8em\", color: \"rgb(97, 93, 93)\"}}>\r\n                            ✧ oops, how did u get here? well, enjoy the stay, pardon the angst. a little cynical & tired here, but the tides are always high. ✧\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        <div className=\"fun-text\">\r\n                            {\r\n                                this.state.blogposts.map((item, index) => {\r\n                                    return this.renderPost(item, index)\r\n                                })\r\n                            }\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div className=\"flex-row flex-center footer\">made while boppin' to city pop 🌃🎶 by Tongyu Zhou</div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/galaxy1.4e99db4b.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/galaxy2.3118bffe.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/galaxy3.874fadf8.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/tigger2.cb53a9a5.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/tigger3.29cd4f00.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/tigger6.33b006ee.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/raytracingbeach.c4604b0c.png\";","import React, { Component } from 'react'\r\nimport { Topbar } from '../topbar'\r\nimport galaxy1 from '../../imgs/galaxy1.png'; \r\nimport galaxy2 from '../../imgs/galaxy2.png'; \r\nimport galaxy3 from '../../imgs/galaxy3.png'; \r\nimport tigger1 from '../../imgs/tigger2.png'; \r\nimport tigger2 from '../../imgs/tigger3.png'; \r\nimport tigger3 from '../../imgs/tigger6.png'; \r\nimport beach from '../../imgs/raytracingbeach.png'; \r\nimport { FaGithubAlt } from 'react-icons/fa';\r\n\r\nimport '../main.css'\r\n\r\nexport class OpenGLApps extends Component {\r\n    constructor(props) {\r\n        super(props)\r\n        this.state = {\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    render() {\r\n        return(\r\n            <div className=\"main-wrapper\">\r\n                <Topbar/>\r\n                <div className=\"about-wrapper\">\r\n                    <div className=\"flex-column pub-wrapper\">\r\n                        <div className=\"center\">\r\n                            This is selection of games and environment-simulations I built using OpenGL and GLUT.\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        <div className=\"fun-text\">\r\n                            <div className=\"title\">\r\n                                Galaxy <span className=\"pad-10\"><a href=\"https://github.com/eutopi/galaxy\"><FaGithubAlt/></a></span>\r\n                            </div>\r\n                            A 2D game inspired by Gem Swap and Space Invaders, Galaxy features an UFO avatar navigating through a grid of asteroids.
